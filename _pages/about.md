I'm a Year 3 PhD candidate in the [Faculty of Education](https://web.edu.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research focuses on educational data mining, artificial intelligence in education, and explainable AI in education. For instance, I leverage AI and explainable AI to model and interpret learner and teacher behaviors and educational dialogues in classrooms and online learning.

During my doctoral study, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Gaowei Chen](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/gwchen) and [Dr. Shihui Feng](https://web.edu.hku.hk/faculty-academics/shihuife) from the Faculty of Education at HKU. 

My publications appear in prestigious journals and conferences, including British Journal of Educational Technology, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, Journal of Science Education and Technology, Educational Technology & Society, Education and Information Technologies, IEEE Transactions on Education, International Journal of Educational Research, Internet of Things, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), and International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM).
